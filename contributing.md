# Algorithms

Please contribute algorithms in the following format:

    # Algorithm
    
           000
           000
           000
        111222333444      (state of the cube after algorithm)
        111222333444      (paste your algorithm into the 'code' section of tio.run/#cubically
        111222333444       and open 'debugging' to see the cube state)

    Significance: Why your algorithm is useful

# Snippets

Please contribute Cubically snippets in the following format:

    # Description
    
        cubically code
    
    Found by: @YourGithub (or Your Name)
    Significance: why your snippet is useful
    Example: `cubically code example` -> what it does

# Periods

Please contribute algorithms with notable periods simply by adding to the existing table. If an algorithm is found to have the same period as one in the table, but is smaller in quarter turn notation, please remove the old one and add that instead.
